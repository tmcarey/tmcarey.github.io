# **Milestone Report**

## Schedule

Week 1: Be able to trace rays on the octree in CUDA with the basic algorithm - *Completed*

Week 2: Be able to render images and generate extremely simple worlds, improve ray performance so we can do reasonably non-noisy illumination - *Completed*

Week 3: Generate larger and more complex worlds, runtime editing of the world. *In Progress*

Week 4: Large edits which restructure the tree, multiple bounce lighting

Week 5: Reserved for polishing, attempt particle stretch goal if possible
